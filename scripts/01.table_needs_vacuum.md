# Periodically check tables needs vacuum

```sql
SELECT
    schemaname,
    relname,
    last_vacuum,
    last_autovacuum,
    vacuum_count,
    autovacuum_count,
    seq_scan,
    last_seq_scan,
    idx_scan,
    last_idx_scan,
    last_analyze,
    last_autoanalyze,
    analyze_count,
    autoanalyze_count
FROM
    pg_stat_all_tables
where
    schemaname in ('public') AND
    (last_vacuum IS NULL OR last_vacuum < NOW() - INTERVAL '3 days') AND
    (last_autovacuum IS NULL OR last_autovacuum < NOW() - INTERVAL '3 days')
order by schemaname, relname
```

## Explanation

 This SQL query is designed to identify tables in the specific schema that have not been vacuumed or autovacuumed within the past 3 days. The results are ordered by table schema and name.

### Usage

1. Run this query periodically (e.g., daily) as a scheduled task or cron job to monitor tables in need of maintenance

## Autovacuum

Autovacuum is a daemon or background utility process offered by PostgreSQL to users to issue a regular clean-up of redundant data in the database and server. It does not require the user to manually issue the vacuuming and instead, is defined in the postgresql.conf file.
