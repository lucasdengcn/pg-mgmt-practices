# Periodically Check Long-running connection

```sql

SELECT pid, usename, client_addr, client_hostname, state, backend_start, query_start, state_change, wait_event, wait_event_type, query_id, query
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE datname = 'postgres'
AND (now() - query_start) > '5 minutes'::interval;

```

## Explanation

This SQL query is designed to identify long-running connections in a PostgreSQL database. It selects various information about the current database sessions, specifically focusing on those that have been running for more than 5 minutes.
