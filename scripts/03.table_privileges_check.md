# Periodically check tables privileges for security

```sql

SELECT 
    table_schema, 
    table_name, 
    grantor,
    grantee as to_user_name, 
    privilege_type,
    is_grantable,
    with_hierarchy
FROM 
    information_schema.table_privileges 
where table_schema in ('public')
ORDER BY 
    table_schema, 
    table_name, 
    grantee;

```

## Explanation

 This SQL query periodically checks the privileges of tables within a specified schema (in this case, 'public') for security purposes. It retrieves information about who has been granted which privileges on each table and whether these grants are transferable.
