# Periodically Check Long-running query

```sql

select
 pid,
 usename,
 query,
 now() - query_start as duration,
 client_addr,
 client_hostname,
 state,
 backend_start,
 query_start,
 state_change,
 wait_event,
 wait_event_type,
 query_id
from
 pg_stat_activity
where
 datname = 'postgres'
 and

 and (now() - query_start) > '1 seconds'::interval
 and query != '<IDLE>'
order by
 duration desc;

```

## Explanation

This SQL query is designed to periodically check long-running queries in a PostgreSQL database. It selects information from the `pg_stat_activity` system view, which provides details about active sessions in the database.
