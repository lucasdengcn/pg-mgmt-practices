# Periodically check tables takes too much on autovacuum

```sql

select
    p.datname as db_name,
    p.relid::regclass AS table_name,
    p.phase,
    a.pid,
    a.query_start,
    now() - a.query_start AS duration,
    a.state_change
FROM
    pg_stat_progress_vacuum p
JOIN
    pg_stat_activity a ON p.pid = a.pid
WHERE
    now() - a.query_start > interval '5 minutes';

```

## Explanation

 This SQL query is designed to identify and monitor long-running autovacuum processes in PostgreSQL databases. It joins the `pg_stat_progress_vacuum` view with `pg_stat_activity` to gather information about ongoing vacuum operations, including their duration and state.
